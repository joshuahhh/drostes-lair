I'm finding it kinda fun to save my informal tests as actual tests!
maybe that will help us teach each other what our code does.

to run tests in CLI watcher:

```sh
yarn test:watch
```

to run tests in web watcher:

```sh
yarn test:ui
```

ui hints:

- for the detailed view, click "Open test details" in the top (file name) row â€“ bad design oh no
- note "Fixed failed snapshot(s)" in the lower rows; useful!
